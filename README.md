# Prio
##### An app to help split time amongst many tasks and manage things like procrastination (hopefully).
### Current Features:
* Countdown timers, as floating windows on your desktop

![Timers List](https://github.com/amrahm/Prio/blob/master/sample_images/timers.png?raw=true)
* Highly configurable
  * Can be bound to Windows 10's virtual desktops, so if you have virtual desktops for specific tasks, the timers will automatically run on those desktops
      * Pairs well with https://github.com/amrahm/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer
  * Can give alerts/play sounds when finishing or running over by set lengths of time
  * Can be prevented from resetting for a set amount of time, based on another timer's progress, or any complex combination of these
  * Can auto-reset at a certain time
  * Can be started/stopped/hidden with configurable shortcuts

### Planned Features:
* A deskband that shows what desktop you're on, and can be configured to show messages and/or popups, etc., if:
  * you're on certain desktops at certain times of the day
  * you haven't gotten a timer for a task down enough and it's getting late
  * etc?
* More etc?
